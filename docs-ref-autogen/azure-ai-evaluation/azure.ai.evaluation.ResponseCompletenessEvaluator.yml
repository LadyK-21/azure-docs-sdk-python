summary: "Evaluates the extent to which a given response contains all necessary and\
  \ relevant information with respect to the\n   provided ground truth.\n\nThe completeness\
  \ measure assesses how thoroughly an AI model's generated response aligns with the\
  \ key information,\nclaims, and statements established in the ground truth. This\
  \ evaluation considers the presence, accuracy,\nand relevance of the content provided.\n\
  The assessment spans multiple levels, ranging from fully incomplete to fully complete,\
  \ ensuring a comprehensive\nevaluation of the response's content quality.\nUse this\
  \ metric when you need to evaluate an AI model's ability to deliver comprehensive\
  \ and accurate information,\nparticularly in text generation tasks where conveying\
  \ all essential details is crucial for clarity,\ncontext, and correctness.\nCompleteness\
  \ scores range from 1 to 5:\n1: Fully incomplete \u2014 Contains none of the necessary\
  \ information.\n2: Barely complete \u2014 Contains only a small portion of the required\
  \ information.\n3: Moderately complete \u2014 Covers about half of the required\
  \ content.\n4: Mostly complete \u2014 Includes most of the necessary details with\
  \ minimal omissions.\n5: Fully complete \u2014 Contains all key information without\
  \ any omissions.\n:param model_config: Configuration for the Azure OpenAI model.\n\
